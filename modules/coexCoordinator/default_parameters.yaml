coex:
  packets_number: 0 # This value means that the CBR traffic duration will be on "duration" value 
  packets_size: 100 # bytes. All BIT to trasmit are: 3000*100*8, that is: 2 400 000 bit
  packets_rate: 0.24 # 0.24Mbps. That is: 240 000 bitps. So the tramission's duration is: 2 400 000 / 240 000 -> 10seconds
  socket_port: 60606
  trace_name: null
  delay_start: 0 # This value is the gap from the primary measure and the coex traffic beginning
  duration: 0 # If this value is 0, the duration is infinite, otherwise the value is the duration it self.
